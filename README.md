# Let-and-Const-Exercise

### Quiz:
- What is the difference between var and let?
  - With var, you are able to reassign AND redeclare. With let, you're limited to being able to reassign.
    Var declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable. Let declares block-scoped local variables.
- What is the difference between var and const?
  - Unlike var, const does not allow reassignment, nor the ability to redeclare. However, if const is an object, its properties can mutate. Like let, const creates block scope.
- What is the difference between let and const?
  - Let allows for reassignment, const does not.
- What is hoisting?
  - Hoisting is a concept where declarations of variables using var are accessible before the initialization of that variable. The variable name is accessible within the scope; however, it will return undefined.
